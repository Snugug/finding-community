The entry point to being a FED is knowing the two core markup languages of the web</li><li><strong>JavaScript Frameworks</strong> - The next skill most FEDs have in their arsenal is JavaScript with frameworks. Tools like jQuery and Dojo are included, but so are Angular, React, and the like.</li><li><strong>Vanilla JavaScript</strong> - The third, and the most critical along with Web Markup, skill for FEDs is being able to read, write, and optimize the core JavaScript language. This includes the actual ECMAScript standard, Web APIs, and the like.</li><li><strong>Non-Browser JavaScript</strong> - The final skill is non-browser JavaScript. Node.js is the biggest player here for both server-side development and build tools, but also IoT. This also could include compile-from and compile-to JavaScript like native development or Web Assembly</li><li><strong>Native Mobile</strong> - There's a whole set of pure native development skills that exist in a similar way to the web development skills outlined above, but the vast majority of our community fall under the web development skills, so that's what we focus on.</li><li><strong>Spectrum</strong> - With these skills defining our community, it no longer matters what location you work in, what division you work for, whether you come from from design or engineering, or what your title is. If these skills are part of your discipline, we consider you part of our FED community</li></ul></aside></section></article><article class="_stage--group"><section class="_stage--slide" data-state="clear"><div class="_stage--content"><h2>Our Story Starts in the Fall of 2014</h2></div></section><section class="_stage--slide" data-state="fade"><div class="_stage--content"><h2 class="ft-fragment">Crisis and Urgency</h2></div><aside class="_stage--notes"><ul><li>General Sense of uneasiness amongst FEDs in the Design Org out of Austin</li><li>One FED conducted a little research<ul><li>Neither Design nor Engineering understood FED as a unique skillset that encompassed both</li><li>On Design teams, many did UX/Research work, not development</li><li>When developing, many found that Engineering didn't view them as &quot;real developers&quot;<ul><li>Instead, viewed as designers who had never worked with &quot;enterprise&quot; code</li></ul></li><li>FEDs in Design often viewed Engineering developers as out-of-date with modern tools, techniques, and best practices</li></ul></li><li>All of this created lots of tension and frustration, with many of our FEDs considering leaving</li></ul></aside></section><section class="_stage--slide" data-state="story"><div class="_stage--content"><h2>Innovators and Community</h2></div><aside class="_stage--notes"><ul><li><p>Innovation started with local practitioners who could leverage local channels to become leaders before FED@IBM existed</p><ul><li><p>Una Kravets, a FED with a background doing technical community organizing, started an IBM Austin-local peer-to-peer knowledge sharing meetup called FED Date</p></li><li><p>Kevin Suttle and Sam Richard, FED thought leaders in their respective business units, created a virtual community on Slack; IBM's first Slack team</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The actions led in January 2015 for Phil Gilbert, the GM of Design, to take action and officially create FED@IBM</p></li><li><p>In February of 2015, Jessica Trembly, Mina Markham, and Alex Carroll, designers and developers in Austin, put together a twice-a-month lunch-and-learn called FEDucation</p></li><li><p>In April of 2015, Damon Deaner, a proven leader from within IBM, was brought in by Phil as a member of the IBM Design Leadership specifically to guide the global FED@IBM community, something that was unique amongst similar disciplines in IBM</p></li></ul></aside></section><section class="_stage--slide" data-state="story"><div class="_stage--content"><h2>A Shared New Vision</h2></div><aside class="_stage--notes"><ul><li>The FED@IBM community identified a number of problems with the way work was currently being done, and those who had risen to be leaders worked with Damon to look in to what changes could be made<ul><li>From very early, we had a shared vision for what the FED discipline at IBM could be<ul><li>Working with modern tools, techniques, and best practices while shipping UI code to production</li></ul></li><li>To get there, we needed our Business Units to acknowledge FED as a unique skill set and career path with specializations, like they already had with design and back-end development</li><li>Interestingly, all of the early leaders had more or less the same vision without needing to discuss it<ul><li>Values around craft were shaped by similar principles, especially Social Coding and Open Source</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></aside></section><section class="_stage--slide" data-state="story"><div class="_stage--content"><h2>Innovation and Action</h2></div><aside class="_stage--notes"><ul><li><p>The programs and communication channels our leaders put together allowed us to diffuse our new vision across our community and grow it</p><ul><li><p>FED Date allows our FEDs regardless of where they came from to share what's new, cool, and relevant for their local group</p></li><li><p>FEDucation provides twice-a-month recorded education to the global community on topics relevant to everyone.

The initial thought was quick, 15-20 minute talks in the morning, with the attendees divided in to teams to hack in the afternoon. We brought in a lot of speakers from across IBM globally. This was a great first attempt, but after feedback, we decided to pivot a little</li><li><strong>Rev 1</strong> - Damon and I worked on a revamped schedule after the 1st Hackademy. Feedback was very positive, but we also knew changes needed to be made. We wound up cutting down and combining all of the small talks in to the 9 major topics we currently cover. We catered in breakfast, lunch, and dinner, knowing how long each day turned out to be. Monday night, we took everyone out for games and dinner. To get the attendees out of the room while dinner was set up the rest of the week, we took them out for what Damon dubbed &quot;Hacky-hour&quot;. This format, including the social events, really have defined what Hackademy is today.</li><li><strong>Rev 2</strong> - 3 Hackademies, 3 different formats! This would become a running theme, us iterating over Hackademy with each event. We introduced hands-on workshops for Git, CSS and Sass, and Vanilla JavaScript in our 3rd Hackademy.</li><li><strong>Rev 3</strong> - Our 4th Hackademy really a turning point for us. All three of the previous Hackademies had been held at IBM's Austin Design studio, but word had spread. There was so much demand for the program that it made more sense to take it on the road. So, during a cold snap in February 2016, Damon and I headed to Toronto to run the first on-the-road Hackademy. Damon and I would spend a week a month for the next 8 months bringing Hackademy to our global studio network.</li></ul></aside></section><section class="_stage--slide" data-state="damon"><div class="_stage--content"><p class="invisible">Damon making a snow angel</p></div><aside class="_stage--notes"><ul><li><p>This is the Damon Deaner we've been talking about.</p><ul><li><p>This is him making a snow angel in the snow in Toronto.
