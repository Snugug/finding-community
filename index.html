The initial thought was quick, 15-20 minute talks in the morning, with the attendees divided in to teams to hack in the afternoon. We brought in a lot of speakers from across IBM globally. This was a great first attempt, but after feedback, we decided to pivot a little</li><li><strong>Rev 1</strong> - Damon and I worked on a revamped schedule after the 1st Hackademy. Feedback was very positive, but we also knew changes needed to be made. We wound up cutting down and combining all of the small talks in to the 9 major talks we currently give, and, to get the attendees out of the room while dinner was set up, started taking them out for what Damon dubbed &quot;Hacky-hour&quot;. This format, including the social events, really have defined what Hackademy is today</li><li><strong>Rev 2</strong> - 3 Hackademies, 3 different formats! This would become a running theme, us iterating over Hackademy with each event. We introduced hands-on workshops for Git, CSS and Sass, and Vanilla JavaScript in our 3rd Hackademy.</li><li><strong>Rev 3</strong> - Our 4th Hackademy really a turning point for us. All three of the previous Hackademies had been held at IBM's Austin Design studio, but word had spread. There was so much demand for the program that it made more sense to take it on the road. So, during a cold snap in February 2016, Damon and I headed to Toronto to run the first on-the-road Hackademy. We would spend a week and a half for the next 9 months on the road together, bringing Hackademy to our global studio network</li><li>Al throughout these Hackademies, we have gathered feedback, learned more about our discipline, and evolved our content to match. I honestly can't say we've delivered the exact same content two times in a row.</li></ul></aside></section><section class="_stage--slide"><div class="_stage--content"><p>The first half of Hackademy are our conference-style talks.
