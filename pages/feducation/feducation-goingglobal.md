  * ‚Ä¶tacos and coffee!

  * Being able to cater in lunch was instrumental to FEDucation's success.  We were able to chat about code over food and everybody appreciated it.  It was an extra enticement to get people to come!

  * However, once we saw the need to go global, we realized that lunch time sessions weren't going to work anymore - in order to include our listeners from across the pond, we needed to move the time to the morning.

  * So now our lucky attendees get the enticement of breakfast tacos and coffee - something our call-in audience is always jealous of!

  * But now that we have moved our sessions to a more accessible time, we have have doubled our listening audience.  People call in from Dublin, Boebligen and Hursely to name a few.
