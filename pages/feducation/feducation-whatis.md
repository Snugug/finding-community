notes: >
  * The format of talks is an hour long presentation followed by Q&A.

  * Talks are normally run from our Austin office, but we have had remote speakers.  The attendees in Austin are the lucky ones - they get breakfast tacos and coffee.

  * Other groups from around the world have also created their own meetups to listen in on FEDucation as a group - Dublin and Boebligen
