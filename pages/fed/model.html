  * Traditionally at IBM, there were two pillar disciplines, UX Design and Back-End Engineering

  * We knew that Front-End Development lies in between the two, and we identified four key skills that made up the FED discipline:

  * **Web Markup** - This is HTML and CSS. The entry point to being a FED is knowing the two core markup languages of the web

  * **JavaScript Frameworks** - The next skill most FEDs have in their arsenal is JavaScript with frameworks. Tools like jQuery and Dojo are included, but so are Angular, React, and the like.

  * **Vanilla JavaScript** - The third, and the most critical along with Web Markup, skill for FEDs is being able to read, write, and optimize the core JavaScript language. This includes the actual ECMAScript standard, Web APIs, and the like.

  * **Non-Browser JavaScript** - The final skill is non-browser JavaScript. Node.js is the biggest player here for both server-side development and build tools, but also IoT. This also could include compile-from and compile-to JavaScript like native development or Web Assembly

  * **Native Mobile** - There's a whole set of pure native development skills that exist in a similar way to the web development skills outlined above, but the vast majority of our community fall under the web development skills, so that's what we focus on.

  * **Spectrum** - With these skills defining our community, it no longer matters what location you work in, what division you work for, whether you come from from design or engineering, or what your title is. If these skills are part of your discipline, we consider you part of our FED community
