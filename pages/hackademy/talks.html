state: hackademy-talks
notes: >
  * We try and keep the curriculum as framework-agnostic as possible, so with limited exceptions the goal isn't to teach our attendees how to build in or use something new

  * **Design for Devs** - IBM Design Thinking overview and activities

  * **Intro to Git and GitHub** - A hands-on introduction to version control with command line Git and the fork/branch/pull request model of GitHub

  * **Accessibility** - Overview of accessibility concepts and technical implementation, with voice over demo and keyboard-only challenge

  * **Architecture** - Engineering Architecture concepts taught and applied to the FED space

  * **Task Runners** - How to automate repeated tasks

  * **Sass** - CSS Preprocessing, and its benefits, taught through Sass

  * **Responsi(ble)(ve) Design** - Responsive design beyond squishy sites

  * **Systems of Design** - Content Strategy and component based design and development

  * **Performance** - Human-centered site performance with the RAIL model and critical path testing/optimization

  * The talks are designed to build on each other, so by the time you get to Performance at the end of Tuesday morning, all of the knowledge will have built to provide a clear path forward for how to deliver a great user experience

<p>The first half of Hackademy are our conference-style talks. They're an hour long each, and designed to deliver conference-like quality and information to those who may not be able to attend events themselves</p>
