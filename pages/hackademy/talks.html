notes: >
  * We try and keep the curriculum as framework-agnostic as possible, so with limited exceptions the goal isn't to teach our attendees how to build in or use something new

  * **Intro to Git** - We previously had this and our Git workshop separate, with a Social Coding talk focused on how to collaborate with our modern tools stack of Slack, GitHub (and the GitHub workflow), Travis, and ZenHub, but we've found many of our attendees are now already familiar enough with them that we're going to be trying our next event without them

  * **Task Runners** - If there is time before our next Hackademy at the end of August, this will be expanded in to general build tools

  * The talks are designed to build on each other, so by the time you get to Performance at the end of Tuesday morning, all of the knowledge will have built to provide a clear path forward for how to deliver a great user experience

  * There are also two workshops:

    * An HTML and CSS workshop to get the attendees hands-on experience writing semantic HTML components and styling them with CSS naming conventions, both of which most haven't been exposed to

    * A Vanilla JavaScript workshop to get them to understand what's natively available in browser without relying on frameworks (an AJAX challenge and an accessible, semantic TODO app)
