  * This is the Damon Deaner we've been talking about.

    * This is him making a snow angel in the snow in Toronto. Notice how he doesn't have a jacket?

    * Yah, he's from San Diego. He didn't come to Toronto with a winder coat

  * Anyway, all throughout these Hackademies, we have gathered feedback, learned more about our discipline, and evolved our content to match. I honestly can't say we've delivered the exact same content two times in a row.
