notes: >
  * The HTML and CSS workshop gets attendees hands-on experience writing semantic, accessible HTML components and styling them with CSS naming conventions, neither of which most have experience with

  * The Vanilla JavaScript workshop gets them to see what can be done natively available in browser without relying on frameworks. We have two challenges here, an AJAX challenge, and an accessible, semantic TODO app
