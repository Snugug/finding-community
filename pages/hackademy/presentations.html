notes: >
  * While teams are making their presentations, the coaches code review each project on across 10 aspects of what had been taught earlier in the week

  * Each team is given 20 minutes to present who their user was, what their solution was, what they've learned, and demo what they made

  * Once all teams are done, we hand out prizes! The project with the highest graded code review and the group's favorite (can't vote for yourself) project win!
