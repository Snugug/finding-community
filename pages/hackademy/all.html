state: hackademy
notes: >
  * In the past two years, we've held 14 Hackademies in 8 countries and 11 cities, reaching almost 600 IBMers

  * This is not the kind of enablement program that happens often; a week long training with social events and world-class content, with no cost to our attendees

  * While it's been an amazing experience as an organizer and presenter, the feedback we've gotten from our attendees has blown us away

  * I think Leigh Williamson, a Distinguished Engineer for IBM Cloud who attended Hackademy 12, sums it up pretty well

  <p>…FED@IBM Hackademy fills in a critical gap that exists in our training between those 2 other skill development events [IBM Design Thinking and code bootcamps].… The FED@IBM Hackademy is the "third leg of the stool" and a vital element for solid end-to-end understanding of modern application architecture and development.</p>
