  * Designed to bring together FEDs from both Design and Engineering arms of our house, who otherwise may be siloed from each-other

  * Unlike other trainings, Hackademy's goal was never that of a bootcamp; it's mission, from the beginning, was to create a shared vocabulary and baseline of what modern FED looks and feels like

  * The program was designed to fill the gaps originally identified as pain points in our community

    * For the new-to-industry developers who knew the cool hot tools but not how to scale them, we teach architecture and systems

    * For the standard-bearer IBMers who had missed out on industry advancements through corporate mandates, we teach Git and build tools and responsive design

    * And for everyone, we reset expectations of FED, teaching that it's a bridge between "traditional" engineering and "traditional" design
