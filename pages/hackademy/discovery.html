  * The goal of the hackathon portion is to put all of the knowledge that's just been dropped in to action immediately, reinforcing it in as real a way as possible

  * We have them do some Design Thinking activities to find a user, understand their problem, and come up with a way forward from a user's perspective

    * This is challenging for most teams! Usually engineers just want to start coding! We work to make sure that they're solving a real user's need, and that the scope they want to tackle is something that's do-able in 2 days

    * We also steer them away from the work on their day jobs. We want quick, creative exploration and we find that the baggage of their day-to-day (no matter how great) gets in the way
