  * The goal of the hackathon portion is to put all of the knowledge that's just been dropped in to action immediately, reinforcing it in as real a way as possible

  * We have them do some Design Thinking activities to find a user, understand their problem, and come up with a way forward from a user's perspective

    * This is challenging for most teams! Usually engineers just want to start coding! We work to make sure that they're solving a real user's need, and that the scope they want to tackle is something that's do-able in 2 days

    * We also steer them away from the work on their day jobs. We want quick, creative exploration and we find that the baggage of their day-to-day (no matter how great) gets in the way

  * The coaches there are available over the next two days to mentor, answer questions, test, unblock, and provide feedback to the teams as they work.

  * The teams are required to use Node for their backend and must have some JavaScript powered feature on their frontend. We provide a bare-bones Node starter for them to use, set up with task running, linting, and continuous delivery to Bluemix that they are encouraged to use

  * At 10am on Friday, Code Freeze is called (timed perfectly to The Final Countdown finishing).

    * We give them a 10 point code review based on the aspects of what we taught

    * They present their work to the rest of the group.

    * The highest-reviewed work, and the group's favorite (can't vote for yourself) project win awards!
