notes: >
  * During these two days, the coaches there are available over the next two days to mentor, answer questions, test, unblock, and provide feedback to the teams as they work.

  * Over 14 events, we've perfected the hacking playlist. It started as combination of Pop Princesses and Boy Bands, and has expanded 80s, 90s, and 00s pop, rock, and rap on a constant shuffle

  * The teams are required to use Node for their backend and must have some JavaScript powered feature on their frontend. We provide a bare-bones Node starter for them to use, set up with task running, linting, and continuous delivery to Bluemix that they are encouraged to use

  * Code Freeze happens at 10am Friday morning (you can tell it's coming because The Final Countdown starts playing)
