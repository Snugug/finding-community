  * Innovation started with local practitioners who could leverage local channels to become leaders before FED@IBM existed
    * Una Kravets, a FED with a background doing technical community organizing, started an IBM Austin-local P2P knowledge sharing meetup
    * Kevin Suttle and I were FED thought leaders in our respective business units, and created a virtual community on Slack
    * Jessica Trembly, a visual designer who helps lead the Austin chapter of the AIGA professional design community, put together a twice-a-month lunch-and-learn called FEDucation
  * The actions led in January 2015 for Phil Gilbert, the GM of Design, to empower FEDucation as an official Design program and create FED@IBM
  * In April of 2015, Damon Deaner, a proven leader from within IBM, was brought in by Phil as a member of the IBM Design Leadership specifically to guide the global FED@IBM community, something that was unique amongst similar disciplines in IBM
