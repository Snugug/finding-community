    * Kevin Suttle and Sam Richard, FED thought leaders in their respective business units, created a virtual community on Slack; IBM's first Slack team
  
  * The actions led in January 2015 for Phil Gilbert, the GM of Design, to take action and officially create FED@IBM
  
  * In February of 2015, Jessica Trembly, Mina Markham, and Alex Carroll, designers and developers in Austin, put together a twice-a-month lunch-and-learn called FEDucation
  
  * In April of 2015, Damon Deaner, a proven leader from within IBM, was brought in by Phil as a member of the IBM Design Leadership specifically to guide the global FED@IBM community, something that was unique amongst similar disciplines in IBM
