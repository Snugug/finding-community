  * The FED@IBM community identified a number of problems with the way work was currently being done, and those who had risen to be leaders worked with Damon to look in to what changes could be made
    * From very early, we had a shared vision for what the FED discipline at IBM could be
      * Working with modern tools, techniques, and best practices while shipping UI code to production
    * To get there, we needed our BUs to acknowledge FED as a unique skill set and career path with specializations, like they already had with design and back-end development
    * Interestingly, all of the early leaders had more or less the same vision without needing to discuss it
      * Values around craft were shaped by similar principles, especially Social Coding and Open Source
