  * The programs and communication channels our leaders put together allowed us to diffuse our new vision across our community and grow it
    * FED Date allows our FEDs regardless of where they came from to share what's new, cool, and relevant for their local group
    * FEDucation provides twice-a-month recorded education to the global community on topics relevant to everyone
      * This includes thought leaders from inside our community and outside
      * FEDucation has hosted Alex Russell, Sarah Drasner, GitHub, VUE, the Mozilla Dev Roadshow, and more!
    * Hackademy, a week long traveling training and enablement program, brings the shared vision directly to those who need it most, giving them direct interaction with our community's thought leaders
  * All of these programs empower our community members with new knowledge and connections with other members of the larger IBM community
  * FED Date and FEDucation have shown quick wins that this type of knowledge is wanted throughout the community. Hackademy gets our community _working in these new ways_ to feel what it can be like, and that way of working is brought back to their teams.
    * Some of the projects done during Hackademy have gone on to become widely-used at IBM and have even helped win client work
