  * The programs and communication channels our leaders put together allowed us to diffuse our new vision across our community and grow it
    
    * FED Date allows our FEDs regardless of where they came from to share what's new, cool, and relevant for their local group
    
    * FEDucation provides twice-a-month recorded education to the global community on topics relevant to everyone. Jessica will be talking more about this next!
    
    * Hackademy, a week long traveling training and enablement program, brings the shared vision directly to those who need it most, giving them direct interaction with our community's thought leaders. Sam will be talking about this later.
  
  * All of these programs empower our community members with new knowledge and connections with other members of the larger IBM community
  
  * FED Date and FEDucation have shown quick wins that this type of knowledge is wanted throughout the community. Hackademy gets our community _working in these new ways_ to feel what it can be like, and that way of working is brought back to their teams.
    
    * Some of the projects done during Hackademy have gone on to become widely-used at IBM and have even helped win client work
