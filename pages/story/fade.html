  * General Sense of uneasiness amongst FEDs in the Design Org out of Austin

  * One FED conducted a little research
    * Neither Design nor Engineering understood FED as a unique skillset that encompassed both
    * On Design teams, many did UX/Research work, not development
    * When developing, many found that Engineering didn't view them as "real developers"
      * Instead, viewed as designers who had never worked with "enterprise" code
    * FEDs in Design often viewed Engineering developers as out-of-date with modern tools, techniques, and best practices
  * All of this created lots of tension and frustration, with many of our FEDs considering leaving
